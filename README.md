Documentary Project Overview: Stories of Fukushima
This documentary project explores the unique perspectives and experiences of individuals in Fukushima, capturing the region’s evolving landscape and the lives of those who shape it. Each participant group contributes a “story” that, together, forms a cohesive narrative on Fukushima’s transformation and resilience.
